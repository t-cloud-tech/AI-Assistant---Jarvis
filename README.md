Jarvis AI – Voice-Controlled Desktop Assistant (by Tirth)

Jarvis AI is a personal desktop assistant powered by speech recognition, offline TTS, and DeepSeek AI.
It performs actions on your laptop, answers questions, opens websites, types text, and interacts with the user using natural voice.

This project represents the first version of a fully virtual AI ecosystem that will later include automation, system control, and a 3D AI avatar.
